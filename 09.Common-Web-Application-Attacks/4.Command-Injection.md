# OS Command Injection

If you see a webpage that is doing something that is likely a wrapper around a command on a command line and passing your input into that command, you are likely to be able to add an os command after it to execute your own code.

a common example is running a ping command to test if another system is up, or possibly even a git clone command where the website is a wrapper around the os command.



you will need to add a `;` to terminate the underlying command and to hijack to add your own command.

in the background eg:

```
<?php system("git " + $_GET['input']);?>
```

you can then add in the GET Request parameter `input=version;ipconfig` and the underlying request will be

```
<?php system("git version;ipconfig);?>
```

NB: If you find you are on windows but you don't know if its `cmd.exe` or `powershell.exe` then you can run this command

```
(dir 2>&1 *`|echo CMD);&<# rem #>echo PowerShell
```

once you have command execution you can execute a reverse shell
